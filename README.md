# Finger-Counter-Deep-Learning
In this lab, I use data that is gathered by my classmates (around 600 images) which pertains to labeling the number of fingers that are held up in a frame. I used a RESnet 18 model to classify the images based on finger count

Also there is a GUI which makes taking and labeling the photo easy
